/*
* FUNCTIONS:
*
* 0. A type of data that contains reusable code
*
* 1. This contained reusable code allows us to execute that code whenever 
* it is called upon
*
* 2. Functions are declared, which creates a variable within the current
* scope, and the variable holds the functions object 
*
* 3. Functions have inputs called parameters, and return a output, which
* by default is undefined
*
* 4. The return statement stops the execution of the function and specifies
* the value that is to be given (returned)
*/






/*
* The two phases to using functions: 
*
* First we must ___? 
* ===> define the function
*
*
* Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?
* ===> call function || invoke function
*/





/*
* What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
*
* ===> A function's parameter is the variable in the declaration of the function
*
* ===> An argument  is the variable's actual value that gets passed into the function
*/






/*
* What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
* 
* function(parameter) {
*   function body   
* }
*
*/





/*
* How do we assign a function to a variable?
*
* var x = a();
*/






/*
* Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
*
* Inputs are specified as named parameters within the function declaration 
*
* Outputs are specified as any value that is returned or printed
*/





/*
* Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.
*/


/*
* Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function 
* and is held in memory somewhere (referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures!
